Shield is designed to keep your server safe and stop raids, as well as being your normal everyday moderation / fun bot.
Shield includes some information commands, Utility commands, and moderation commands, economy commands and soon a lot of others.

Our moto : "Never judge a book by its cover", meaning try before you judge :)
